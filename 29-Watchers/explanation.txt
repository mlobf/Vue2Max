Some Thoughts about this mess.

->Methods
  Can be used for event binding ...OR......
  .... Data  Binding, {{ dataBindingOnTemplate }}(use by template).
      Data Binding, method is executed for every 're-render' cycle of the 
        component.
        So use it for events or data binding that really needs to be re-evalueded 
        all the time. Aka-> {{ events }}

->Computed
  Use with data binding, only.
    There are great to derive data thats based in other data with the advantage 
      that they will only be re-evalueded and re-executed by Vue, only, if the dependent data changed.

->Watch 
  Are not used directly by template, but you can "Watch" every data.
  So They allows to run code in reaction to some change data. Aka: HTTP requests, set some timer,
  Use for any non data updates you wanna make.

Usually Watchers are the least used of thoose elements, the more commom are the Methods and, after it, Computed.
